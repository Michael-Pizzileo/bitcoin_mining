bitcoin_mining
==============

A simple bitcoin mining system for use on a Digilent Nexys 3 fpga board.
This is just a personal project of mine and the goal is for it to be educational, so use it at your own risk.
Currently can do three double-sha hashes per 64 cycles at 80MHz, for a theoretical rate of 3.75 MH/s
